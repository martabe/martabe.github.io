First talk about Petunia!

The edition of the World Petunia Days were hosted by the group of Robert Schuurink from the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam.

I have been presenting the plan of my PhD project and some preliminary results about the role of the scent transporter *PhABCG1* previously described in *Petunia hybrida*, in the wild petunia species (*P. axillaris*, *P. exserta*, *P. inflata*).
