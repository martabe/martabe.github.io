My last World Petunia Days (for now :) )!

This edition was organised by the group of Teemu Teeri, at the University of Helsinki.

I presented some results about the relevance of scent transporter protein in some scented wild species of Petunia. 
I got good feedback and criticisms from some of the greatest experts in floral volatiles!
