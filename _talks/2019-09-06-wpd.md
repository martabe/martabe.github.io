My second World Petunia Days!

This time organised by the Bombarely group, from the University of Milan. The setting was a beautiful villa on the lake of Garda.

I presented the preliminary results of my PhD project "Identification of speciation genes driving the morphological diversity of *Petunia* species".

The project is based on a GWAS analysis performed on a natural population of hybrids. The phenotypic traits analysed are relative to flower morphology, and the genomic data were obtained from low coverage sequencing.

The population was described with classical population genetics methods: admixture analysis, PCA, heterozygosity.

At the conference I got some nice feedback from the community and met other people studying population genetics of wild petunias, yay!
