My second World Petunia Days!

Presenting the preliminary results of my PhD project "Identification of speciation genes driving the morphological diversity of *Petunia* species".

Project is based on a GWAS analysis performed on a natural population of hybrids. The phenotypic traits analysed are relative to flower morphology, and the genomic data were obtained from low coverage sequencing.

The population was described with classical population genetics methods: admixture analysis, PCA, heterozygosity.

At the conference I got some nice feedback from the community and met other people studying population genetics of wild petunias, yay!
